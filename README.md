# Canonical: Ubuntu Core Engineering Manager Take Home Test

These are the test results of the Ubuntu Core Engineering Manager Take Home Test.

The results are located in the [marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager/) repository.

# Exercise 1

Solution can be found at [exercise1](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager/edit/main/exercise1) folder.

## Assumptions

The Bash script makes several assumptions:

* Run the bash script on Ubuntu 22-04 LTS (minimal)
* The script stops after the first error
* The script logs the steps (-x) 
* Builds the latest stable kernel version, but an existing image could improve the speed of the script
* Uses busybox to simplify the creation of the initrd image

# Exercise 2

## Instructions

Solution can be found at [exercise1](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager/edit/main/exercise2) folder.

The Shred function can be found [shred.go](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager/edit/main/exercise2/shred.go) and a some tests at [shred_test.go](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/canonical-ubuntu-core-engineering-manager/edit/main/exercise2/shred_test.go)

You can execute the tests:
```
cd exercise2
go test
```
## Assumptions

The Shred function makes several assumptions about the file that it receives as input:
* The file is a regular file. Otherwise the function returns an error. Note that for symbolic links this behaviour is debatable.
* The file is readable and writable. Otherwise the function returns an error.
* There is enough memory and free file descriptors to execute the function.
* The file system supports the sync system call which flushes file data to disk and ensures that the data is written to persistent storage.
* The file is not being written by another process. Otherwise the behaviour is platform specific, in general undefined.
* Shred assumers that the file is not locked (if the OS allows it). 


The file is not locked: Shred assumes that the file is not locked by another process, and can be overwritten.


##Â Possible test cases 

The possible test cases can be envisioned:

* (implemented) If a file does not exist, the Shred function should return an error.
* (implemented) If a file exists, after the execution of the function the file should not not longer be present.
* (implemented) If a big file exists (1 MB), after the execution of the function the file should not not longer be present.
* (implemented) Test that the function returns an error when the file is not a regular file (directory or pipe).
* (implemented) Test that the function handles file permissions correctly. For example, try running the function on a read-only file and ensure that it returns an appropriate error. Not all acess rights combinations tested.
* Test that the file is not recoverable after being shredded. You could use a data recovery tool to attempt to recover the shredded file and ensure that the recovered data is random and not the original file contents.
